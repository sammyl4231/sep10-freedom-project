## Chosing a topic

For this project I chose Chemistry because I was always curious about how and why it's used in the world. I did also consider doing this project on fitness or graphic design, since these are my 2 runner-ups, but I decided I was more interested in learning about Chemisrty instead. I realized that many people don't even realize they're using chemistry in their daily lives. Here is a link that I found interesting, about how chemistry is used in everyday life with things we don't realize are chemistry related: [What is the Application of Chemistry in Daily Life](https://www.advancedchemtech.com/what-is-the-application-of-chemistry-in-daily-life/#:~:text=Chemistry%20is%20used%20in%20daily,using%20antibacterial%20soap%2C%20and%20more.). What I found interesting in this article is that we use chemistry everyday without really thinking or knowing about it. For example, when you boil water for food to kill bacteria or when you brush your teeth, toothpaste contains chemicals like flouride.

## Engineering Design Process

I just started learning about Chemistry now. The problem is that people aren't aware that they're using Chemistry everyday in their lives. Next I plan on researching more about daily use of Chemistry in life. I also plan on asking my peers to grab information and see how many people are aware or not of how much their using Chemistry in their daily lives.

## Skills

Skills I learned from this blog  are researching, communication, planning, and  managing my time.

I researched different sites about the daily uses of chemistry in life. It tells me what chemistry is and what it's about. It's a way to gather information I need, mostly for doing projects.

I use communication to understand the knowledge of chemistry from  my peers' opinions. We all have different points of view, whenever someone agrees or disagrees with my own or each other's.

Planning is also helpful because it's part of what I'm doing. Whether I'm asking my peers or researching at some point. 

Time management is also useful because I need the time to ask my peers and research about chemistry. Depending on how long the researching is and my peers' opinions are, I must have the chance and the right time to do it.

## Next steps

I'm looking forward to learning more about daily chemistry in life!
