For this project I chose Chemistry because I was always curious about how and why it's used in the world. I did also consider doing this project on fitness or graphic design, since these are my 2 runner-ups, but I decided I was more interested in learning about Chemisrty instead. Here is a link that I found interesting, about how chemistry is used in everyday life with things we don't realize are chemistry related: [](https://www.advancedchemtech.com/what-is-the-application-of-chemistry-in-daily-life/#:~:text=Chemistry%20is%20used%20in%20daily,using%20antibacterial%20soap%2C%20and%20more.)
