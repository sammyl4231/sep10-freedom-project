## Chosing a topic

For this project I chose Chemistry because I was always curious about how and why it's used in the world. I did also consider doing this project on fitness or graphic design, since these are my 2 runner-ups, but I decided I was more interested in learning about Chemisrty instead. I realized that many people don't even realize they're using chemistry in their daily lives. Here is a link that I found interesting, about how chemistry is used in everyday life with things we don't realize are chemistry related: [What is the Application of Chemistry in Daily Life](https://www.advancedchemtech.com/what-is-the-application-of-chemistry-in-daily-life/#:~:text=Chemistry%20is%20used%20in%20daily,using%20antibacterial%20soap%2C%20and%20more.). What I found interesting in this article is that we use chemistry everyday without really thinking or knowing about it. For example, when you boil water for food to kill bacteria or when you brush your teeth, toothpaste contains chemicals like flouride.
