# Entry 1: Deciding on my topic (Chemisrty)

##### 10/24/23

## Choosing a topic

The topic I chose for this project is chemistry. I always wanted to learn more about science, and I wanna learn and find new ways to see science on Earth. I love science and I'm currently taking Chemistry class in 10th grade. This is my first ever time learning about chemistry, so I don't know much about it just yet. I'm looking forward to learning more about chemistry in the future.

## Design Process

I'm currently in the first stage of studying chemistry where the first priority is to understand what chemicals are. I'm hoping to learn more about how the science of chemistry applies to our everyday lives. What I can do is research about chemistry using websites and textbooks, or in a lab class with my classmates. I can also ask my peers to discuss about what chemistry can do and what it's used for.

## Skills

Some skills I've been learning: Lab safety, working in a lab, and cooperating with peers

#### Lab saftey

Before we do an experiment, we must protect ourselves from toxic chemicals. We must wear safety goggles, lab coats, latex gloves, etc. Chemicals are harmful to our bodies. We must also tie hair up and closed-toe shoes. We cannot eat, drink, play with chemicals, etc. Ingesting chemicals can result in death.

#### Working in a lab

When we're working in the lab, we must respect the chemicals. We need to handle everything carefully, otherwise it'll make a toxic mess. It's always important to tell the teacher when somehting goes wrong during an experiment. When glass breaks, you must tell the teacher, don't touch it with bare hands, it'll make you bleed. If you get chemicals in your eyes, the lab provies an eye wash. If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop and roll.

#### Cooperating with peers

When you and your peers need assistance, you must ask each other or the teacher for help. When working with chemicals, you must not randomly mix chemicals if you don't know what they'll do when mixed. If you ask your peers or teacher, you will know how to pass the experiment. Working together to complete the experiments and following all the safety rules will result in us achieving out goal successfully.

## Next steps

I look forward to learning more about chemicals and their purpose.
