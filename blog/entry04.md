## Tentative tool tinkering

The tentative tool I decided on for this assignment is called CSS Flexbox. I tinkered with this tool by puzzle solving and moving to the next level of code. When I browsed this tool, I found puzzle solving and debugging to be rather fun. One of them I used when I started my sophomore year is [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet). Flexbpx can also be used to create fun puzzle sloving games like [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

##### Flexbox Froggy

```CSS

#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content
}

```

##### FreeCodeCamp

```CSS

.parent {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}

```

## Skills

Some skills I used while doing this were debugging, growth mindset, time management, problem decomposition, and attention to detail.

### Debugging

Whem I'm trying to correct the code, I must find the error that's making the program run the wrong way. When the problem is spotted, I need to identify which code is running it, and fix it so it runs properly.

### Growth Mindset

When I get stuck or struggle debugging or finding the right code, I ask for help when I need it. I never give up, I'm determined and I know I will succeed. When I give up and not ask for help, I won't learn what I need to learn in life.

### Time management

I always want to do my work on time and not submit it late and fail. I always try to find the right times to do my important things before the deadline.

### Problem Decomposition

When something I'm working on looks complicated, I go step by step, little by little to make it slightly easier and understandable. This helps me because I will already understand what's givin to me in the task.

### Attention to Detail

When I'm working on tasks, sometimes I make mistakes. But that's ok because I learn from them and remember the right thing for next time. I don't like making mistakes, because they make my task look like I did it wrong.

## Professionalism

Using CSS Flexbox to convey my learning helps me find out what's the wrong code and debug any errors that's making the code run incorrectly. When I keep doing this, I can become a pro at it, and even learn how to create and run my own code and program!
