## Tentative tool tinkering

The tentative tool I decided on for this assignment is called CSS Flexbox. I tinkered with this tool by puzzle solving and moving to the next level of code. When I browsed this tool, I found puzzle solving and debugging to be rather fun. One of them I used when I started my sophomore year is [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet). Flexbpx can also be used to create fun puzzle sloving games like [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

##### Flexbox Froggy

```CSS

#pond {
  display: flex;
  justify-content
}

```

##### FreeCodeCamp

```CSS

.parent {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}

```

## Skills

Some skills I used while doing this were debugging, growth mindset, time management, problem decomposition, and attention to detail.

### Debugging

Whem I'm trying to correct the code, I must find the error that's making the program run the wrong way. When the problem is spotted, I need to identify which code is running it, and fix it so it runs properly.
