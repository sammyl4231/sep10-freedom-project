### Content

When I started working the actual freedom project, I had faced many challenges and was very lazy to do some things on it. My challenges were the formatting, sizing, and positioning. My takeaways doing the project were to resize and reposition the bootstrap card and carousel. After I finished the project, in class, my classmates and I were presenting our projects. My challenges were going up in front of the class and presenting. I'm a very shy person when it comes to going in front of a whole crowd of people. It was also how I was speaking; I was stammering and very nervously laughing while I was sharing. My takeaways during the in-class presentation were that everyone got to see what my project is, and they've learned about Chemistry. My peers were asking me questions about my project, and told them what it was. My takeaways from my Expo Elevator Pitch were that people who saw my project were interested and learned about Chemistry if they've never heard of it.

### Engineering Design Process

At this time when I was finishing the final parts my Freedom Project, I was at the point where I was sharing my results with many different people around the school. My plans for the next stage are to be more fluent with what I'm talking about and to be less shy. I can introduce myself by saying my name first before going over the product, and end with a "Thank You".

### Skills

For this freedom project, the skills I used were collaboration, communication, debugging, how to google, growth mindset, attention to detail, consideration, and creativity.

Using consideration, creativity, and attention to detail, I first considered the freedom project was gonna be see by other poeple. I payed attention to what I was doing and how I was organizing the codes and CSS. I was experiencing a lot of issues with the outputs of the codes and CSS. They were coming out huge and mispositioned, and I had to make many revisions, which I also had issues with. So using collaboration, I asked my peers, teacher, and on slack for assistance. Using debugging, I was able to find the mistakes in my CSS, and finally got the right help to fix them.
