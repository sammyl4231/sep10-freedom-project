When I started working the actual freedom project, I had faced many challenges and was very lazy to do some things on it. My challenges were the formatting, sizing, and positioning. My takeaways doing the project were to resize and reposition the bootstrap card and carousel. After I finished the project, in class, my classmates and I were presenting our projects. My challenges were going up in front of the class and presenting. I'm a very shy person when it comes to going in front of a whole crowd of people. It was also how I was speaking; I was stammering and very nervously laughing while I was sharing. My takeaways during the in-class presentation were that everyone got to see what my project is, and they've learned about Chemistry. My peers were asking me questions about my project, and told them what it was.
