## Chemistry

Context: What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of the science of chemicals.
Chemistry has been used on Earth for thousands of years.
Have you ever wondered what Chemistry is and what it can do?
Reading this will help you understand the story of Chemistry and its usages, followed by gadgets that use it and are powered by it.


Tools being used throughout the decades:
Chemists use a compressor: 
1762

- Compressors are a mechanical device used to increase the pressure of gas

- Compressors increase the pressure of gas by reducing its volume

Chemists use an absorption tower (aka Spray Tower): 
1830

An absorption tower is a large tank for absorbing gases

It allows gaseous phases pass into a liquid phase

Chemists use an adsorption column: 
1881

An adsorption column is when particles stick to a solid substanceâ€™s surface without going through it, it stays there with intermolecular forces

Adsorptions are concentrations in fluid phase and solid adsorbent change overtime and their position in the fixed bed, as adsorption proceeds

Chemists use an agitated vessel: 
1951

Agitated vessels exchange heat and are mostly used in lots of chemical and biochemical process industries

The mass transfer for the most part involves dispersed gases absorbing into and often reacting with an ongoing liquid phase.

Chemists use a centrifuge: 
1864

Centrifuges apply a sustained centrifugal force - due to rotation

Centrifuges are used to separate liquids/fluids and gases, depending on their density
