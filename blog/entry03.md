## Chemistry

Context: What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of the science of chemicals. Chemistry has been used on Earth for thousands of years. Have you ever wondered what Chemistry is and what it can do? Reading this will help you understand the story of Chemistry and its usages, followed by gadgets that use it and are powered by it.

Tools being used throughout the decades:

Chemists use a compressor:

These were used in 1762. Compressors are a mechanical device used to increase the pressure of gas. Compressors increase the pressure of gas by reducing its volume.

Chemists use an absorption tower (aka Spray Tower): 
1830

An absorption tower is a large tank for absorbing gases. It allows gaseous phases to pass into a liquid phase.

Chemists use an adsorption column: 
1881

An adsorption column is when particles stick to a solid substanceâ€™s surface without going through it, it stays there with intermolecular forces. Adsorptions are concentrations in fluid phase and solid adsorbent change overtime and their position in the fixed bed, as adsorption proceeds.

Chemists use an agitated vessel: 
1951

Agitated vessels exchange heat and are mostly used in lots of chemical and biochemical process industries. The mass transfer for the most part involves dispersed gases absorbing into and often reacting with an ongoing liquid phase.

Chemists use a centrifuge: 
1864

Centrifuges apply a sustained centrifugal force - due to rotation. Centrifuges are used to separate liquids/fluids and gases, depending on their density.

## Brainstorming Possible Solutions (future technologies)

Technology can sometimes be used in chemistry. Technology in chemistry is used to power electric gadgets like cars. Technology can be used in chemistry by using electronic devices to measure and do experiments. For example, a tool called a hotplate can be used to form chemical reactions to heat samples, culturing cells, chemical synthesis, sample preparation, etc. Usually technology in chemistry is used to heat up elements and samples to form chemical reactions. Another example is Textile Displays, which are used in wearable electronics like Virtual Reality Headsets. Textile Displays emit intertwined light to form flexible displays. Like fiber batteries, this allows wearble electronic devices to allow you to flex and breathe.

## Skills

Some skills I learned are how to read, how to Google, time management, and creativity

### How to read

I obviously didn't read through the million of websites to find the information, I only read the ones that were most thorough and clearest to view. The most helpful website I read was [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) and [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/) although I read different websites to find information. MDPI was also helpful for finding information besides Wikipedia.

### How to Google

Google was another most helpful site for information. I Googled about apps and devices related to Chemistry. Google mainly showed results of traits of Chemistry devices and tools and apps on a bullet point list. Google bullet point lists also lead to websites that contain the bullet point words.

### Time Management

I always want to be wise of the time. When writing a blog entry, I always want to be organized when including everything it needs. The titles, headings, subheadings, list(s) or text. I always want to submit my assignments on time, so I manage my time to focus on one step at a time when working on an assignment.

### Creativity

When I write a Blog Entry, I always want to make sure that it looks thorough, so my teacher approves it, because he always wants to see as many details as possible. I also want it to look the most informative so when other students and my teacher read it, they approve it and I pass the assignment with a passing grade. It looks better when it has multiple details about the subtopics of my topic.
