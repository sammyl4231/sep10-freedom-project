## Chemistry

Chemists use a compressor: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg/220px-ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg

- Compressors are a mechanical device used to increase the pressure of gas

- Compressors increase the pressure of gas by reducing its volume

Chemists use an absorption tower: https://www.metso.com/contentassets/cf355c94b47446a39d1fc138e4afaf15/absorption-image-1.jpg?preset=preset_575x400

An absorption tower is a large tank for absorbing gases

It allows gaseous phases pass into a liquid phase

Chemists use an adsorption column: https://chembam.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/img_6748.jpg

An adsorption column is when particles stick to a solid substanceâ€™s surface without going through it, it stays there with intermolecular forces

Adsorptions are concentrations in fluid phase and solid adsorbent change overtime and their position in the fixed bed, as adsorption proceeds

Chemists use an agitated vessel: https://img2.exportersindia.com/product_images/bc-full/2020/1/603624/agitated-vessel-1579079732-5255255.jpeg

Agitated vessels exchange heat and are mostly used in lots of chemical and biochemical process industries

The mass transfer for the most part involves dispersed gases absorbing into and often reacting with an ongoing liquid phase.

Chemists use a centrifuge: SCL302.jpg

Centrifuges apply a sustained centrifugal force - due to rotation

Centrifuges are used to separate liquids/fluids and gases, depending on their density
