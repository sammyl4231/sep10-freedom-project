* [I went to this website for CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

CSS Flexbox is used make easier design flexible-responsive structure without using float or positioning. When you begin using it, you must start with a container with 3 flex items.

I learned from CSS Flexbox that the flex container properties are flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, and align-content. Flex-direction defines the direction the flex items are stacked in the container. Flex-wrap specifies if the items should wrap or not. Flex-flow is shorthanded for setting both flex-direction and flex-wrap. Justify-content is used to align flex items, putting them in the middle of the container.

The CSS Flex Items consist of Child Elements, used to automatically make a flex container flexible. The properties are order, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basics, flex, and align-self. Order specifies the arrangement of flex items in a container. Flex-grow specifies how much a flex item grows compared to the rest. Flex-shrink does the opposite, flex items will look smaller compared to the rest. Flex-basis specifies the initial length of an item. Align-self specifies the alignment for the selected item in the container and overrides the alignment set by align-items.
