## Context

#### What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of chemicals. It is used everyday in our lives for certain utilities and needs. Chemistry is found in machines, substances, elements, etc. There are calculations of measurement, atoms, ions, etc, and identifications of elements. The Periodic Table is an important prop of Chemistry, chemists use them for experiments and tests to see if they change color, feel hot, or interact in many different ways. Chemists use a hotplate to heat samples of substances to see if they change color or react in a certain way.

## Timeline

Chemistry has been around from the 16th-17th centuries. Over the centuries, many builders have constructed many devices that are being used throughout history and today. These machines have supplied us with our needs and have really changed things throughout history.

#### History of Chemistry and inventions

[Chemists use a compressor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg/220px-ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg)

* Compressors are a mechanical device used to increase the pressure of gas

* Compressors increase the pressure of gas by reducing its volume


[Chemists use an absorption tower](https://www.metso.com/contentassets/cf355c94b47446a39d1fc138e4afaf15/absorption-image-1.jpg?preset=preset_575x400)

* An absorption tower is a large tank for absorbing gases

* It allows gaseous phases pass into a liquid phase

* Chemists use an adsorption column: https://chembam.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/img_6748.jpg

* An adsorption column is when particles stick to a solid substanceâ€™s surface without going through it, it stays there with intermolecular forces

* Adsorptions are concentrations in fluid phase and solid adsorbent change overtime and their position in the fixed bed, as adsorption proceeds


[Chemists use an agitated vessel](https://img2.exportersindia.com/product_images/bc-full/2020/1/603624/agitated-vessel-1579079732-5255255.jpeg)

* Agitated vessels exchange heat and are mostly used in lots of chemical and biochemical process industries

* The mass transfer for the most part involves dispersed gases absorbing into and often reacting with an ongoing liquid phase.


[Chemists use a centrifuge](SCL302.jpg)

* Centrifuges apply a sustained centrifugal force - due to rotation

* Centrifuges are used to separate liquids/fluids and gases, depending on their density


#### MVP

* I can find which bootstrap component I would like to use to start setting up my website
* I can start coding in cs50.dev
* I can change the colors and fonts of the text
* I can add the images and information

#### Beyond MVP

Not sure if I'll do this after May 1.
