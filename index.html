        <strong>Chemistry Crocodile: What's Chemistry you ask? Great question! Allow me to explain!</strong> Chemistry is the study of chemicals. It is used everyday in our lives for certain utilities and needs. Chemistry is found in machines, substances, elements, etc. There are calculations of measurement, atoms, ions, etc, and identifications of elements. The Periodic Table is an important prop of Chemistry, chemists use them for experiments and tests to see if they change color, feel hot, or interact in many different ways. Chemists use a hotplate to heat samples of substances to see if they change color or react in a certain way.

        <strong>Chemistry Crocodile: Chemistry has been around for centuries. Let me explain to you what has happened during that time.</strong> Chemistry has been around from the 16th-17th centuries. Over the centuries, many builders have constructed many devices that are being used throughout history and today. These machines have supplied us with our needs and have really changed things throughout history. Scroll down to view some Chemistry machinery that has been around during these centuries.

    <div class="g-col-6">Compressor
      <p>A compressor is a tool powered by chemistry. Compressors are a mechanical device used to increase the pressure of gas. Compressors increase the pressure of gas by reducing its volume. They force atmospheric air under pressure to create potential energy, and then convert it to kinetic energy. That's when the compressed air is released, and pressure builds up.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="g-col-6">Absorption Tower
      <p>An absorption tower is a large tank for absorbing gases. It allows gaseous phases to pass into a liquid phase. Additionally, chemists use an adsorption column. An adsorption column is when particles stick to a solid substanceâ€™s surface without going through it, it stays there with intermolecular forces. Adsorptions are concentrations in fluid phase and solid adsorbent change overtime and their position in the fixed bed, as adsorption proceeds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="g-col-6">Agitated Vessel
      <p>Agitated vessels exchange heat and are mostly used in lots of chemical and biochemical process industries. The mass transfer for the most part involves dispersed gases absorbing into and often reacting with an ongoing liquid phase. The agitator is driven by an electric motor, rotating the impellers within the vessel. It facilitates mixing and blending.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="g-col-6">Centrifuge</div>
    <p>Centrifuges apply a sustained centrifugal force - due to rotation. Centrifuges are used to separate liquids/fluids and gases, depending on their density. They rotate at rapid speeds, which separate substances using the power of centripetal force. The applied force can even be several hundred to thousand times of Earth's gravity!</p>
