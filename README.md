# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Samantha Lee**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Chemistry**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Chemistry** in order to help me make by website.
